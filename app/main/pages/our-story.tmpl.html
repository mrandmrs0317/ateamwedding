			<p>Alex and Aaron met in March 2014 on a dating website.<br/>Yes, it's a thing that happens now. </p>
			<p>He didn't know many people in town and she was too busy with pole and finishing school to have much of a social life.<br/>Fun Fact: He first messaged her over their shared interest in Magic the Gathering.</p>
			<p>On their first date, they met at a tapas restaurant called 100 Montaditos, which is now a ZaZa's (thank goodness for that!). She was wearing a track suit and he was wearing a Job for a Cowboy shirt. Needless to say, love at first sight. That night they spent a lot of time talking, laughing and eating sandwiches.</p>
			<p>They had such a wonderful time together that they decided they never wanted to be apart again and spent every day together being awesome and going on adventures. (True story.)</p>
			<p>Which is why you're on this site: to help celebrate with them their newest adventure, marriage!</p>
