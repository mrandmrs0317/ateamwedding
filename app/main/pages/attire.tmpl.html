<p>The dress code for this event is Formal with the option of Black-tie. It is an elegant evening affair, so please dress accordingly.
March weather in Florida is rather nice and can sometimes have a slight chill. We are hoping for some nice weather in the 70’s by the time we begin at 4pm. But living in Florida, you never reeeally know.</p>
<h2>Ladies:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Any form of high heels, kitty kat heels, and even dressy flats are encouraged. Please no flip-flops or sneakers.</p></li>
<li><p>Long dresses or formal cocktail dresses with dark or spring colors (i.e those featured on the website)</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware that the ceremony is on the Grande Lawn when selecting your shoes. Luckily, however, the cocktail hour by the Reflection Pool and Ballroom reception will be high-heel/stiletto-friendly.</p></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Gentlemen:</h2>
