			<p>
			Aaron and I have slowly, but surely, begun
			
			building our lives together. We are very
			
			grateful to have everything we need for our
			
			home.
			
			As a young couple, however, travel is often
			
			the last thing in the budget. So in lieu of
			
			traditional housewares we hope you enjoy
			
			browsing our &quot;experience&quot; registry through
			
			Honeyfund!
			
			For your convenience, a registry link has
			
			been provided for both Honeyfund and a
			
			traditional registry.</p>
